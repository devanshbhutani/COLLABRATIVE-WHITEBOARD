# Eraser and Shape Selection Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Eraser Tool Improvements

**Problem**: The eraser was not working like Microsoft Paint - it only erased entire elements when the mouse was over them, rather than allowing partial erasing of pencil strokes.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented a **partial eraser** that works like a real eraser - removes only the parts it touches
- The eraser now splits pencil strokes into multiple segments when partially erased
- **NEW**: For shapes (circles, rectangles, lines, text), the eraser reduces opacity gradually instead of removing them entirely
- Added visual feedback with a red dashed circle indicator showing the eraser size and position
- The eraser size is now based on the brush size setting, making it more intuitive
- Added proper mouse tracking for the eraser indicator

**Key Changes**:
- Updated `handleMouseMove` in `Canvas.jsx` to implement partial eraser logic
- Added `mousePos` state to track cursor position for the eraser indicator
- Added visual eraser indicator in the `redrawCanvas` function
- Added `handleMouseEnter` to ensure proper mouse position tracking
- **NEW**: Implemented stroke splitting logic that creates multiple strokes when a single stroke is partially erased
- **NEW**: Added opacity-based erasing for shapes (circles, rectangles, lines, text)
- **NEW**: Added `globalAlpha` support to all drawing functions for opacity rendering

### 2. Shape Selection and Resizing Fixes

**Problem**: When drawing shapes and trying to resize them, the system was selecting all elements instead of just the specific shape being edited.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the `selectedIndex` state management to properly track which element is being resized
- Improved the selection logic to work with the `selectedElements` array instead of relying solely on `selectedIndex`
- Enhanced the resize handle detection to work with the correct element
- Added proper state synchronization between selection and resizing operations

**Key Changes**:
- Updated `handleMouseDown` to properly set `selectedIndex` when clicking on elements
- Modified resize handle detection to work with `selectedElements[0]` instead of `elements[selectedIndex]`
- Added proper `setSelectedIndex` calls when starting resize operations
- Fixed the auto-selection of newly drawn shapes for immediate editing

### 3. Visual Improvements

**Added**:
- Visual eraser indicator (red dashed circle) when eraser tool is active
- Better cursor management using CSS data attributes
- Improved tool button styling for the eraser tool
- Enhanced selection and resize handle visual feedback
- Better canvas styling with improved borders and shadows

## Technical Details

### Partial Eraser Implementation
The eraser now works by:
1. Tracking mouse position continuously when eraser tool is active
2. Drawing a visual indicator showing the eraser size
3. Checking intersection with pencil stroke segments using `distToSegment` function
4. **Splitting strokes into multiple segments** when partially erased
5. Creating new stroke elements for each remaining segment
6. Supporting different eraser sizes based on the brush size setting

**Stroke Splitting Logic**:
- When the eraser touches a pencil stroke, it identifies which segments are affected
- Unaffected segments are kept together as continuous strokes
- Affected segments are removed, creating gaps in the original stroke
- The remaining segments become separate stroke elements
- Each new stroke gets a unique ID for proper tracking

**Shape Erasing Logic**:
- For circles, rectangles, lines, and text, the eraser uses a different approach
- Instead of removing shapes entirely, it gradually reduces their opacity
- Each eraser pass reduces opacity by 15% (minimum 5% opacity)
- Shapes become progressively more transparent with each eraser pass
- When opacity reaches 5%, the shape is completely removed
- This creates a more natural erasing effect similar to real erasers on paper

### Selection System
The improved selection system:
1. Properly manages both `selectedElements` array and `selectedIndex` state
2. Allows single and multi-selection with Ctrl/Cmd key
3. Automatically selects newly drawn shapes for immediate editing
4. Provides proper resize handle detection for selected elements
5. Maintains selection state during drawing operations

## Usage

### Partial Eraser Tool
1. Select the eraser tool (ðŸ§½) from the toolbar
2. Adjust the brush size to control eraser size
3. **For pencil strokes**: Click and drag over strokes to erase only the parts you touch
4. **For shapes (circles, rectangles, lines, text)**: Click and drag to gradually reduce opacity
5. The red dashed circle shows the eraser area
6. **NEW**: Pencil strokes will be split into multiple segments when partially erased
7. **NEW**: Shapes become progressively more transparent with each eraser pass

### Shape Editing
1. Draw any shape (rectangle, circle, line)
2. The shape will be automatically selected
3. Click and drag the blue handles to resize
4. Click and drag the shape body to move it
5. Use Ctrl/Cmd + click for multi-selection

## Files Modified

- `client/src/components/Canvas.jsx` - Main canvas logic and event handlers
- `client/src/components/Whiteboard.css` - Visual styling and cursor management
- `ERASER_AND_SELECTION_FIXES.md` - This documentation file

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Partial Erasing (Pencil Strokes)
1. Draw a long curved line with the pencil tool
2. Select the eraser tool
3. Drag the eraser over the middle of the line
4. The line will be split into two separate strokes, with the middle part erased
5. You can continue drawing or erasing the remaining segments

### Precision Correction (Pencil Strokes)
1. Draw detailed artwork with multiple pencil strokes
2. Use a small eraser size for precise corrections
3. Erase only the parts that need fixing
4. The remaining parts of each stroke stay intact

### Shape Erasing (Circles, Rectangles, Lines, Text)
1. Draw various shapes (circles, rectangles, lines, text)
2. Select the eraser tool
3. Drag the eraser over the shapes
4. Watch as the shapes become progressively more transparent
5. Continue erasing to make them completely disappear
6. This creates a natural erasing effect similar to real erasers

### Mixed Content Erasing
1. Create a drawing with both pencil strokes and shapes
2. Use the eraser tool on different parts
3. Pencil strokes will be split into segments
4. Shapes will become transparent gradually
5. This provides a consistent and intuitive erasing experience
