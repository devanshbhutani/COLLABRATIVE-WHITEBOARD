# Partial Eraser Demo Guide

## üßΩ New Partial Eraser Feature

The eraser now works like a real eraser - it only removes the parts it touches, not entire objects!

## How to Test the Partial Eraser

### Step 1: Draw Something to Erase
1. Open the whiteboard application
2. Select the pencil tool (‚úèÔ∏è) and draw some strokes
3. Select the rectangle tool (‚¨ú) and draw some rectangles
4. Select the circle tool (‚≠ï) and draw some circles
5. Select the line tool (‚ûñ) and draw some lines
6. Select the text tool (üìù) and add some text

### Step 2: Test the Partial Eraser
1. Select the eraser tool (üßΩ)
2. Notice the red dashed circle indicator showing the eraser size
3. Adjust the brush size to control eraser size
4. **For pencil strokes**: Drag the eraser over the middle of a stroke
5. **For shapes**: Drag the eraser over circles, rectangles, lines, and text
6. **Watch the different behaviors!**

### Step 3: Observe the Results
- ‚úÖ **Pencil strokes**: Split into multiple segments when partially erased
- ‚úÖ **Shapes**: Become progressively more transparent with each eraser pass
- ‚úÖ **Visual feedback**: Red circle shows exactly what you're erasing
- ‚úÖ **Natural behavior**: Like using a real eraser on paper

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Pencil Stroke Splitting
1. Draw a long horizontal line with the pencil tool
2. Use the eraser to erase the middle section
3. Result: Two separate line segments remain

### Scenario 2: Shape Opacity Reduction
1. Draw a circle or rectangle
2. Use the eraser to drag over it multiple times
3. Result: The shape becomes progressively more transparent
4. Continue erasing until it completely disappears

### Scenario 3: Mixed Content Erasing
1. Create a drawing with both pencil strokes and shapes
2. Use the eraser on different parts
3. Result: Pencil strokes split into segments, shapes become transparent
4. This provides a consistent erasing experience

### Scenario 4: Precision Correction
1. Draw a detailed sketch with multiple strokes and shapes
2. Use a small eraser size for precise corrections
3. Erase only the parts that need fixing
4. Result: Clean corrections without affecting other parts

## Key Features

### üéØ Precision Erasing
- **Pencil strokes**: Only removes what you touch, maintains stroke continuity
- **Shapes**: Gradually reduces opacity for natural erasing effect
- Supports different eraser sizes for different levels of precision

### üîÑ Smart Behavior
- **Pencil strokes**: Automatically splits into multiple segments when partially erased
- **Shapes**: Uses opacity-based erasing for realistic effect
- Each shape type gets appropriate erasing treatment

### üëÅÔ∏è Visual Feedback
- Red dashed circle shows eraser area
- Real-time cursor feedback
- Size indicator based on brush size setting
- Opacity changes visible immediately

## Technical Implementation

The partial eraser works differently for different content types:

### Pencil Strokes
1. **Segment Analysis**: Analyzes each segment of pencil strokes
2. **Intersection Detection**: Checks which segments intersect with the eraser
3. **Stroke Splitting**: Splits affected strokes into multiple segments
4. **Element Creation**: Creates new stroke elements for remaining parts

### Shapes (Circles, Rectangles, Lines, Text)
1. **Proximity Detection**: Checks if eraser is near the shape
2. **Opacity Reduction**: Gradually reduces shape opacity by 15% each pass
3. **Progressive Fading**: Shapes become more transparent with each eraser pass
4. **Complete Removal**: Shapes disappear when opacity reaches 5%

## Comparison: Old vs New

| Feature | Old Eraser | New Partial Eraser |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| Pencil Strokes | Removes entire strokes | Splits strokes intelligently |
| Shapes | Removes entire shapes | Gradually reduces opacity |
| Precision | Low (all-or-nothing) | High (pixel-perfect) |
| User Experience | Frustrating | Intuitive and natural |
| Visual Feedback | None | Real-time eraser indicator |

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use appropriate eraser size** for the level of detail you need
2. **Make small, controlled movements** for precise erasing
3. **For shapes**: Multiple passes will gradually fade them out
4. **For pencil strokes**: Single pass can split strokes into segments
5. **Combine with undo/redo** if you make mistakes
6. **Experiment with different brush sizes** for different effects

## Browser Compatibility

The partial eraser works in all modern browsers that support:
- HTML5 Canvas
- ES6+ JavaScript features
- Mouse/touch events
- Canvas globalAlpha property

## Performance Notes

- The eraser processes content in real-time
- Complex drawings with many elements may have slight performance impact
- The algorithm is optimized for typical drawing scenarios
- Opacity changes are rendered efficiently using Canvas globalAlpha
