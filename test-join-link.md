# Join Link Functionality Test Guide

## How to Test Join Links

### Step 1: Create a Room
1. Open the app in your browser at http://localhost:5174
2. Enter your name (e.g., "Creator")
3. Click "Create Room"
4. You should be taken to the whiteboard with room ID displayed
5. **NEW**: You may see a notification permission request - allow it for better experience

### Step 2: Copy the Share Link
1. In the whiteboard, click the "ðŸ”—" button next to your username
2. This copies the share link to your clipboard
3. The link format should be: `http://localhost:5174/join/ROOMID?name=Creator`

### Step 3: Test Join Link
1. Open a new incognito/private browser window
2. Paste the share link in the address bar
3. You should see the "Join Whiteboard Room" page
4. Enter a different name (e.g., "Joiner")
5. Click "Join Room"

### Step 4: Verify Join Request Flow
1. **Joiner**: Should see a loading screen: "Waiting for room leader approval..."
2. **Creator**: Should see:
   - An alert notification: "New join request from Joiner! Click the ðŸ‘¥ button in the header to review."
   - A pulsing red button with "ðŸ‘¥ 1" in the header
   - Browser notification (if permission granted)
3. **Creator**: Click the "ðŸ‘¥ 1" button to open join requests modal
4. **Creator**: Approve or reject the join request
5. **Joiner**: Gets notified and joins the room or gets rejected

## Expected Behavior

### For Creator:
- âœ… Gets immediate notification when someone wants to join
- âœ… Sees pulsing "ðŸ‘¥" button in header with request count
- âœ… Can click button to review all pending requests
- âœ… Can approve/reject requests with clear UI
- âœ… Gets browser notifications (if permission granted)

### For Joiner:
- âœ… Sees "Waiting for approval" screen instead of confusing alerts
- âœ… Gets notified when approved/rejected
- âœ… Can join the room after approval

## Troubleshooting

If join links don't work:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify server is running on port 3001
3. Verify client is running on port 5174
4. Check that the room ID in the URL is correct
5. Ensure the creator is still in the room
6. **NEW**: Check if notification permissions are granted

## Server Logs to Watch

Look for these log messages:
- "Join request from [username] sent to room [roomId] leader"
- "[username] approved to join room [roomId]"
- "[username] rejected from room [roomId]"
